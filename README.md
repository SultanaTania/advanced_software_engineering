********************************* For 1 ********************************* 

Project Code: As soon as I finished each module,I put the code for each on my https://github.com/SultanaTania/advanced_software_engineering/tree/main/Project link.

UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:
                              
							  1. Activity Diagram
							  2. Use Case Diagram
							  3. State Diagram

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. 
Five points for clean code:
 
1.	Naming Convension: Throughout the project I tried to give all the variable a meaningfull name.
2.	Write meaningfull comment: I write comment whenever it needed. 
3.	Do not use long parameter: I didn’t use any mehod with a long paremeter list instead of making a data class object to passed it. Screnshort can be found: 
4.	Error handing: I handle all the possible errors. For that I used null checking as well as try…catch methods.
5.	Remove unused code: After completing each module, I removed the unused code/import. 

All of Screnshort can be found:
